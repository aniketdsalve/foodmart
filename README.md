Looks like I can’t directly open that GitHub repo right now, but no worries — I can still help you create a **clean README.md**.

I’ll base it on a standard format for a project named **Foodmart** (assuming it’s a web app or static site deployed via Apache as per your earlier EC2 script).

Here’s a simple but professional README:

---

```markdown

It’s lightweight, easy to deploy, and perfect for experimenting with web hosting setups on Apache or cloud environments.

Aniket, if you confirm the **exact contents** of the repo (HTML pages, assets, any framework like Bootstrap or JS libraries), I can refine this README to match it perfectly — even add screenshots and a clean demo section.  

👉 Do you want me to make a **polished version with badges, screenshots, and a “Live Demo” section** so it looks more professional on GitHub?
